# FIFA WORLD CUP DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In FIFA world cup the amount of data that we want to deal with is 
humongous.This database management system aims at building an efficient 
system to manage data tactfully.
The database contains information about players,venues,goals,matches and a 
lot more stuff.
This will help the FIFA committee to access various types of information and 
improve the quality of conduction of these games in the future. They can also 
keep track of the amount of resources required during the games and assess 
how many more will be needed
